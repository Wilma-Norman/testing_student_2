GuestList:
    listItem - A prop passed into the component that holds an array of messages.
    messages - This state keeps track of the current list of messages displayed
    on the page. Initially, it is set to listItem, but it gets updated when new messages are added.
        Components inside GuestList: 
            NewMessage: 
                This component includes an input field and a "Send" button.
                When a user enters a message and clicks "Send", it triggers
                the setMessage function to add the new message to the list.
            List: 
                Is responsible for rendering each individual message.
                The map() function is used to loop through the messages 
                array and render each message inside a styled container.

NewMessage: 
    useState: to be able to use the message och setMessage
    input: To leave a message
        here we also need an onChange to update the message variable
    button: A button to send the message to its parent component with the onSend method. 

List: 
    useState true - handles the messages visability with help from isVisible
        setIsVisible - is used to update if the message should be hidden or shown
        useState false - handles if the message is set to important with the help of 
        setImportant. This one sets the value of the message being important or unimportant.
        And also a setShow that will hide the message or show the message. 
    Button: to be able to toggle between the setIsVisible, setImportant and setShow with the
    toggleVisibility function. 
    Button: to toggle the importance of a message with the toggleImportant function.

There are Images in the Image folder to show the function of the website more clearly!
